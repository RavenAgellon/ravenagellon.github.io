                <h2>School</h2>
                <p>I graduated with a diploma in Computer Engineering from Singapore Polytechnic in the year 2021. </p>
                <p>It was a very unique experience for me during my time in Singapore Polytechnic. I am exposed to a class that comes from a diverse backgrounds.
                    I have peers who graduated from ITE, O'Level students, International Students, as well as students from Polytechnic Foundation Programme.
                    Coming from an Polytechnic Early Admission Exercise (EAE) student, I was keen to socialise with people from different cultures. 
                </p>
                <p>I learnt many things during my time in Polytechnic and did many hands-on projects that allows me to figure out what kind of jobs I would like to pursue.
                    It also broadens my perspective of different type of coding languages and know my strengths and weaknesses of each one. Despite the challenges
                    that affected my 3rd year due to Circuit Breaker on 2020, I had to discipline myself to do my own researches and still be able to hand my work
                    on time.

                <h2>Hobbies / Interests</h2>
                <p>Listening to music, watching movies/TV-series, and video games are one of the things 
                    I would do to pass time. Whenever I am free, I would stream myself playing video games on Twitch and try to connect
                    and socialise with random people online
                </p>
                <p>I also consider myself as a curious person, whereby I would often try new things/activities to experience. Once I get the hang of it,
                    I would then strive for excellence and do my very best to achieve it well. I am known to never give up on the tasks I am handed, especially
                    when those tasks caught my attention.
